# Architecture & Engineering Decisions

## ADR-001 — Core technology stack
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: Greenfield project; product owner specified preferred technologies.
Decision: Use Next.js for the application, PostgreSQL as the database, and Grafana Loki for logging.

## ADR-002 — Plans stored in `plan/`
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: Plans need to persist across agent sessions.
Decision: Every implementation plan is saved as a file in `plan/` (see `AGENTS.md` → Project Operating Rules).

## ADR-003 — Commit on every shipped feature
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: Product owner wants Git history updated as soon as features ship.
Decision: Git repository initialized; each feature is committed once it completes the five-pillar lifecycle (see `AGENTS.md` → Project Operating Rules).

## ADR-004 — MVP boundary: discovery and application only
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: The platform could stop at matching or also handle messaging, contracts and payments; that choice drives data model, security and legal scope.
Decision: MVP covers profiles, opportunity posting, search, applying, and accept/reject. Messaging, contracts, payments and reviews are out of MVP scope.

## ADR-005 — Only MSMEs post listings in MVP
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: "Post and find" could mean both sides post listings.
Decision: In the MVP only MSMEs post opportunities (freelance or internship). Students have profiles and apply. Student service listings and a student directory are deferred.

## ADR-006 — Email verification plus admin approval of MSMEs
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: Fake or scam listings aimed at students are the main trust risk.
Decision: Every user verifies their email. An admin role approves each MSME, and an MSME's listings are not visible to students until approval.

## ADR-007 — Sign-in with email/password and Google
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: Need a sign-in method that is familiar to students and supports email verification.
Decision: Support email and password (with email verification) and Google sign-in. Auth library choice is still open.

## ADR-008 — Local Docker Compose first; production hosting deferred
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: No production hosting decision yet; want no cost or lock-in during MVP build.
Decision: Develop locally with Docker Compose running Next.js, PostgreSQL, Loki and Grafana. Production hosting will be decided later and recorded as a new ADR.

## ADR-009 — Application technical stack
Date: 2026-09-25
Context: Remaining technical choices after ADR-001.
Decision: TypeScript, Next.js App Router, Prisma ORM (PostgreSQL, Prisma Migrate), Better Auth (email/password + Google), Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui, pino for structured logging shipped to Loki, Vitest for unit/integration tests and Playwright for end-to-end tests. Package manager: npm.
